# User Features Performance Optimization Analysis

**Date:** July 12, 2025  
**Focus:** Mobile-first user experience optimization  
**Context:** Most users access sedekah.je from mobile browsers

## Executive Summary

After analyzing the user-facing features in `app/(user)/`, several performance optimization opportunities have been identified. While the current implementation is functional, there are significant improvements that can be made specifically for mobile users, particularly around caching, data fetching patterns, and mobile UX optimizations.

## Critical Performance Issues =¨

### 1. Missing Caching for User Queries
**Files:** 
- `app/(user)/my-contributions/_lib/queries.ts:29-63`
- `app/(user)/leaderboard/_lib/queries.ts:26-131`

**Issue:** No `unstable_cache` implementation on user-facing queries
- My Contributions page: No caching for user's contribution data
- Leaderboard page: No caching for stats and top contributors
- Layout auth check: No caching for session verification

**Impact:** Every page load triggers fresh database queries
- **Mobile Impact:** Poor experience on slow 3G/4G connections
- **Server Impact:** Unnecessary database load for repeated requests

**Solution:** Implement `unstable_cache` with appropriate TTL and cache keys

### 2. N+1 Query Pattern in Leaderboard
**File:** `app/(user)/leaderboard/_lib/queries.ts:93-120`

**Issue:** Individual user lookups for each top contributor
```typescript
const topContributors = await Promise.all(
  topContributorsResult.map(async (result, index) => {
    // Individual database query for each contributor
    const user = await db.select().from(users)...
  })
);
```

**Impact:** 5+ database queries for leaderboard (1 for contributors + 1 per user)
- **Mobile Impact:** Significant delay on cellular connections
- **Scalability:** Performance degrades with more contributors

**Solution:** Single JOIN query to fetch user details with contributions

### 3. Inefficient Stats Calculations
**File:** `app/(user)/leaderboard/_lib/queries.ts:26-78`

**Issue:** Multiple separate queries for leaderboard statistics
- 4 separate database calls for simple counts
- Complex aggregation patterns that could be optimized

**Impact:** Unnecessary database round trips
- **Mobile Impact:** Slower page loads on mobile devices
- **Database Impact:** Higher database load than necessary

## Mobile UX Issues =ñ

### 4. No Progressive Loading for User Data
**Files:**
- `app/(user)/my-contributions/page.tsx`
- `app/(user)/leaderboard/page.tsx`

**Issue:** Blocking page render until all data loads
- No loading skeletons for stats cards
- No progressive enhancement for slow connections

**Impact:** Poor perceived performance on mobile
- **User Experience:** Blank screen during data loading
- **Bounce Rate:** Users may leave before content appears

### 5. Heavy Form Components on Mobile
**File:** `app/(user)/contribute/_components/institution-form.tsx`

**Issue:** Large form bundle with heavy dependencies
- QR extraction libraries loaded upfront
- Location services with network calls
- No lazy loading for optional features

**Impact:** Slow initial load on mobile devices
- **Bundle Size:** Heavy JavaScript payload
- **Network**: Multiple API calls during form interaction

### 6. Limited Offline Support
**File:** `public/sw.js:1-30`

**Issue:** Basic service worker with minimal caching strategy
- Only caches static assets and homepage
- No caching for user data or API responses
- No offline indicators for users

**Impact:** Poor offline experience
- **Mobile Usage:** Users often have intermittent connectivity
- **PWA Experience:** Limited offline functionality

## Data Fetching Patterns =

### 7. No Request Deduplication
**Issue:** Multiple components may trigger same queries
- User session checks across multiple components
- Duplicate contribution fetches in different views

**Impact:** Unnecessary network requests
- **Mobile Impact:** Data usage and battery drain
- **Performance:** Redundant API calls

### 8. Missing Incremental Updates
**Issue:** Full page refresh for data updates
- After form submission, full page revalidation
- No optimistic updates for user actions

**Impact:** Poor mobile interaction experience
- **UX**: Slow feedback after user actions
- **Data Usage**: Unnecessary full page reloads

## Specific Mobile Optimization Opportunities =ò

### 9. Image Optimization Issues
**Current:** Next.js automatic image optimization working
**Gap:** No WebP/AVIF format optimization for user-uploaded QR codes
- QR images stored in original format
- No responsive image sizing for mobile

### 10. Navigation Performance
**File:** `app/(user)/_components/nav.tsx`

**Current:** Mobile-first drawer navigation implemented
**Gap:** No preloading of navigation routes
- No route prefetching for main user pages
- Drawer animation may feel sluggish on older devices

## Recommended Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Critical Performance (Week 1)
1. **Implement caching for user queries** (2-3 hours)
   - Add `unstable_cache` to my-contributions and leaderboard queries
   - Use user-specific cache keys with 300-600 second TTL

2. **Fix leaderboard N+1 query** (2 hours)
   - Replace Promise.all with single JOIN query
   - Optimize stats calculation into single query

3. **Add progressive loading** (3 hours)
   - Implement loading skeletons for user pages
   - Add Suspense boundaries for async components

### Phase 2: Mobile UX Enhancement (Week 2)
4. **Optimize form loading** (4 hours)
   - Lazy load QR extraction features
   - Split form into smaller chunks with dynamic imports

5. **Enhance offline support** (3 hours)
   - Cache user data in service worker
   - Add offline indicators and fallbacks

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 3)
6. **Implement request deduplication** (2 hours)
   - Use TanStack Query for client-side caching
   - Add optimistic updates for form submissions

7. **Image optimization** (2 hours)
   - Implement WebP/AVIF conversion for QR uploads
   - Add responsive image sizing
