1. avoid using pgenums because its hard to manage on prod when we want to add or remove values. use object constants instead
2. avoid using useEffect to fetch data. fetch at server component, then pass in as props if the child component needs it.
3. its a public repository, so please be extra careful when dealing with things related to security.
