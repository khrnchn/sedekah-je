# SedekahJe

this was my 16th july speedrun project in the office before going home. built using v0 + claude.

had this website idea before when i came across this [pdf](https://www.muamalat.com.my/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/LIST-OF-QR-CODE-FOR-E-DERMA.pdf).

currently tracking and adding qrs from [catqeel](https://x.com/catqeel)'s [twitter thread](https://x.com/catqeel/status/1822939660135645502).
